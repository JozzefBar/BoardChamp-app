## üìã Description

BoardChamp allows users to record their board game results and save them locally on the device in JSON format. This enables easy management of game history and tracking of progress.

Users can create and manage individual "cards" for each board game, allowing them to keep track of multiple different games. There is no limit to the number of game cards a user can create, making it easy to organize and maintain statistics across a variety of board games.

Moreover, users can log detailed statistics including the date and time range during which the game was played. They can also record the players involved, their final rankings, and optionally add notes summarizing the outcome or any important details about the game.

Additionally, users can browse their game history to see when and what games were played. They have the option to edit or update specific details of past game sessions.

## ‚è≥ Functionality that was planned but not done
- A button from the main menu that would create a new scenario, where there would be **player statistics** - this is related to the possibility of automatically adding someone with a name similar to the one the user enters when adding a new player, so that there would be no case where there are two names, _Josh_ and _JOSH_, and because of the different characters it would be taken as two different players. Therefore, the statistics would also show them differently.
